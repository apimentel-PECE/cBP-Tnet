Abstract—Traditional cuff-based blood pressure (BP) monitoring methods provide only intermittent readings, while invasive alternatives pose clinical risks. Recent studies have demonstrated feasibility of estimating continuous non-invasive cuff-less BP using photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals alone. However, existing approaches rely on complex manual feature engineering and/or multiple model architectures, resulting in inefficient epoch training numbers and limited performance. This research proposes cBP-Tnet, an efficient single-channel and model multi-task Transformer network designed for PPG signal automatic feature extraction. cBP-Tnet employed specialized hyperparameters—integrating adaptive Kalman filtering, outlier elimination, signal synchronization, and data augmentation—leveraging multi-head self-attention and multi-task learning strategies to identify subtle and shared waveform patterns associated with systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). We used the MIMIC-II public dataset (500 patients with 202,956 samples) for experimentation. Results showed mean absolute errors of 4.32 mmHg for SBP and 2.18 mmHg for DBP. For the first time, both SBP and DBP meet the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation’s international standard (<5 mmHg, >85 subjects). Furthermore, the network efficiently reduces the epoch training number by 13.67% when compared to other deep learning methods. Thus, this establishes cBP-Tnet’s potential for integration into wearable and home-based healthcare devices with continuous non-invasive cuff-less blood pressure monitoring.
